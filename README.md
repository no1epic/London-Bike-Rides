# London Bike Rides Analysis

## Overview
The "London Bike Rides" project is a data-driven analysis of bike-sharing usage patterns in London. The analysis provides valuable insights into bike usage trends, weather impact, and temporal variations. The project combines data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization using Python and Tableau.

## Dataset
The dataset includes bike-sharing trip details, weather data, and temporal features. Key fields include:
- **Date and Time:** Timestamp for each trip.
- **Weather Conditions:** Information on temperature, humidity, and weather types.
- **Bike Count:** Number of bikes used.

### Files Used:
1. `london_bikes.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for preprocessing and analysis.
2. `london_bikes_final.xlsx`: Final dataset after cleaning and transformations.
3. `london_merged.csv`: Merged dataset combining bike and weather data.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Tableau Public:** For data visualization.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For exploratory data visualization.

## Process
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Merged bike-sharing and weather datasets.
- Cleaned missing values and standardized formats.
- Generated additional features such as hour, day, and month for temporal analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Identified peak usage hours and days of the week.
- Analyzed weather impact on bike-sharing trends.
- Visualized temporal trends in bike usage.

### 3. Visualization
The Tableau dashboard highlights:
- **Usage Patterns:** Hourly and daily trends.
- **Weather Impact:** Bike usage variations by weather conditions.
- **Temporal Analysis:** Seasonal and monthly trends.

## Insights
- Peak usage occurs during commuting hours on weekdays.
- Adverse weather conditions significantly reduce bike-sharing activity.
- Summer months see the highest bike-sharing activity.

## Future Enhancements
- Include data from additional cities for comparative analysis.
- Integrate real-time data for live dashboard updates.
- Use predictive modeling to forecast bike usage trends.
